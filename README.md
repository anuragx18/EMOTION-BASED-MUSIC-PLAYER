# EMOTION-BASED-MUSIC-PLAYER
Designed and developed a web application using HTML/CSS/JavaScript and Django/Python that detects the user's emotions through a Haar Cascade algorithm and a CNN classifier trained on six emotions (Angry, Happy, Disgust, Neutral, Surprised, and Sad). 
The application recommends a set of songs and changes its background theme based on the user's detected emotion. This project involved integrating OpenCV and TensorFlow for machine learning, training the classifier on Colaboratory, and implementing a user-friendly frontend.
The Emotion Recognition Music Player achieved a 91% accuracy rate in detecting all six emotions.
